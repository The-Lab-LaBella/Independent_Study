# Undergraduate Research

This page will provide information about the opportunities and options for **Undergraduate Research** in the LaBella lab. 

The availability of the opportunities is dependent on the number of open positions in the lab and funding availability. Please reach out to Dr. LaBella at least the semester before you are interested in conducting research. 

There are multiple ways to be involved in the ongoing authentic scientific research being conducted in the lab. Please read the guidelines and expectations I've included below. Then, I will review the various options available for undergraduate research.

&nbsp;

## What is Authentic Scientific Research??

Authentic scientific research seeks to answer questions you cannot look up or to develop tools or objects that have not been created. 

There are multiple ways for undergraduates to engage in the active research programs at UNC Charlotte and within our lab. Research experience is a valuable complement to coursework, allows students to delve deeper into a specific area of scientific research, and provides a unique opportunity for first-hand experience in a research environment.

## What Research is Happening in the LaBella Lab

In our lab, we use computer science to uncover "hidden" patterns in DNA that help us ask questions about the organisms around us. To read more about our ongoing research, please visit our website https://www.lablabella.com/. 

The lab has a diverse group of undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral researchers. The doctoral (PhD student) and post-doctoral (post-PhD researcher) researchers are each working on their own independent research projects that address a specific hypothesis in our lab group. The undergraduate and master's researchers often work with a doctoral or post-doctoral researcher as their direct mentor. 

&nbsp;

## What You Can Expect to Gain in a Research Experience

- **Experience doing real scientific research.** In the lab you will either be doing your own independent research project or working collaboratively on an established research project.
- **Experience being a part of a research team.** Science is collaborative, and you will have the opportunity to work with other researchers at different career levels.
- **Career preparation.** We will build skills that you can use on your resume. I will also provide letters of recommendation for those that meet the research expectations.
- **Experience reading scientific literature.** This project will likely take you to topics beyond what you have learned in class. You will build skills in reading scientific literature during your research and at our lab meetings.
  
&nbsp;

## What I Expect from You, the Undergraduate Researcher 

- **Work independently on your research project for the specified number of hours per week** Each opportunity will have a specific number of hours dedicated to research. For computational projects, you will be responsible for keeping track of your hours and working independently. This can be in our computational lab or at your home/office. 
- **Arrive on time and prepare for our weekly one-on-one meetings** Each week, you will meet one-on-one with your primary mentor. Please arrive on time and be prepared for this meeting. This time is essential for us to monitor progress and troubleshoot. 
- **Attend and prepare for weekly lab meetings** Unless your schedule does not allow it, you are expected to attend and prepare for the weekly lab meeting. The entire lab meets weekly to discuss peer-reviewed papers and share research updates. 
- **Maintain a lab notebook, have good data management, and write up summaries of their work.** Your research will be used by others in our field, and in the lab. So, you'll need to keep a record of your work and keep all your data in an organized structure. Some of your work may also be included in a published manuscript. If that occurs, you will receive authorship or acknowledgment, depending on the contribution.

## Types of Undergraduate Research Opportunities 

Below are the types of research opportunities in the lab. **Not all opportunities will be available every semester.**

&nbsp;

### Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR) Scholar Positions 

You can find the full details here: https://our.charlotte.edu/programs/academic-year-programs/

The Office of Undergraduate Research funds multiple paid research positions for undergraduate students. 
During the academic year, full-time Scholars can earn up to $2000 per semester, and part-time Scholars can earn up to $1000 per semester.

**If you are interested in these positions, I need to know at the beginning of the semester prior to your interest.** For example, if you would like to participate in an OUR position in Fall 2026, you will need to inform me in the first month (January) of Spring 2025. 

You will then need to apply to the program and select my lab as your preferred opportunity. There is no guarantee you will be selected for a OUR Scholar Position. 

&nbsp;

### Paid Undergraduate Researcher - Federal Work Study (FWS)

If you have federal work-study funding available, this can be used to fund your position as an Undergraduate Researcher. The standard salary for these positions in the lab is $11/hour. FWS students are awarded up to $4,000 per academic year. The exact salary and work hours will be determined by the allotment of federal work study. 

FWS positions will be posted on hire-a-niner. Allow for 1-2 months for the hiring process to be complete
